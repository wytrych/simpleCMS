!2 Hello there\!

To see how this message was generated start !s edit! mode or look at content/example.txt. 

The principals are very simple:

*A new line automatically generates a <p> element.
*It's safe to use < and > as these symbols are converted to HTML entities

Currently working tags are: !s strong, a, code, h2, h3, img!. The use of these is as follows:

*!s strong! - generated with \!s strong\!
*!l;example.com;a! - generated with \!l;example.com;a\!
*You can also omit the alternative name for the link and simply use !l example.com!
*!c some code! - generated with \!c some code\!
*To generate a heading use a new line starting with \!2 for h2 or \!3 for h3:
*A beautiful kitten: 
!p !i;img/kitten.jpg;'Kitten in Rizal Park, Manila' by Kenny Louie!
!2 Large heading
!3 Small heading

*To make an unordered list begin every new line in the list with an asterix (*) 

Empty lines and whitespace are omitted except when used in the multiline code tag:

!c
This
       is
           preformatted text
  and it      doesn't parse tags like !s this!

You need to close this block with a ! on a new line.

!

The exclamation mark needs to be exited with a backslash: \! is generated by \\!

!3 Thank you for your patience and have fun\!
